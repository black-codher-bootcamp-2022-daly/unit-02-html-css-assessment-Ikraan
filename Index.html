<h2>About Me</h2>

<I>Hello there! My name is Ikraan Ahmed, but most people call me 'Iki' for short. I was born in the Netherlands, came to the U.K when I was 5 years old; I have spent most of my life living in London, however I relocated to Birmingham after completing college. This enabled me to focus on my studies leading me to further my education at university. I am a law graduate who completed LLB law at the university of Wolverhampton, however, even after finishing university I still have that student mindset of constantly wanting to educate myself on more skills and knowledge. I am an ambitious, focused and committed individual; with administrative, customer service background; currently taking steps to change career paths and seeking an opportunity within the technology field. I am currently a Black Codher Full-stack developer bootcamp studentüë©‚Äçüéì</p>
